## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [Pixarium](https://pixarium.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Upload images by providing image URLs.
- Display images in a responsive grid layout.
- Real-time addition of images to the gallery.
- Simple, intuitive UI for image management.

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- CSS Grid (for responsive layout)
- Vite (for fast development environment)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Pixarium.git
   cd Pixarium
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The app is built with React and uses the `useState` hook for managing the state of the image list.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Image Display:** Images are displayed in a grid layout using CSS Grid, with responsiveness for different screen sizes.
2. **Real-Time Updates:** Once an image is added, it instantly appears in the gallery without requiring a page refresh.
3. **Image Upload:** Users can enter the URL of an image and upload it by clicking the "Upload Image" button.


## Future Improvements

- Drag-and-Drop Upload: Allow users to upload images by dragging them into the app.
- Image Upload via File: Allow users to upload images from their local file system instead of just via URL.
- Image Deletion: Add functionality to remove images from the gallery.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **CSS Grid:** Learning to implement a responsive grid system that adjusts to various screen sizes.
- **State Management:** Using Reactâ€™s `useState` to dynamically update the list of images and properly re-render the components.
- **Componentization:** Structuring the app into reusable components like `Uploader`, `ImageGrid`, and `ImageItem` to maintain clean and maintainable code.
